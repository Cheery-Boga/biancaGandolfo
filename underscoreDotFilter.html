
filter takes an array and a callback
returns a new array that only contain the values that return true from the callback.
the callback has to return a boolean. So, it needs to return either true or false. If it returns true, it gets added to our array.
the length of the new array doesn't have to be the same length as the original array. 
this fiter method is often called the 'truth test'

What happens below the hood is the following code for the _.fiter method:

const _ = {}; 

_.filter = function (array, callback) {
    // create a new array; 
    let storage = []; 
    // loop thru the array; 
    _.each(arr, function (element, i, array) {   // the reason we don't use _.map, here, is because we want to sort and filter the array with a truthy value. Map will return both                                                 falsies and thruthies onto our storage array
        if (callback(element, i, array) === true) {  // you can also eliminate the === true, and make the entire statement a truthy. this will check if the element is true.
            storage.push(element);
        }
    })
    return storage; 
}

<!-- in the array below, there is a flag. A flag is a property that has true or false as its value.
